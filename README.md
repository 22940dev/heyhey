# Facebook Messenger Bot

This example project creates a Facebook Messenger bot.

It's an echo bot that responds to a user's message by repeating their message back to them. It's a useful starting point for building your own Facebook Messenger bot.

It uses Express and the Node client for the Facebook Messenger Platform by [remixz](https://github.com/remixz/messenger-bot), that provides a number of methods to perform common tasks, like authenticating with Facebook, verifying your token and sending messages.
