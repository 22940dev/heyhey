# Facebook Messenger Bot

This example project creates a Facebook Messenger bot, completely
mirroring the quickstart located in [Messenger Platform docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start).

It's an echo bot that responds to a user's message by repeating their message back to them. It also sends a generic template when a message with "generic" text is received. This project is not dependent on any external libraries and can easily be extended.

## Getting Started
To get started you need to:
- Set up your Facebook app on Facebook
- Configure your Facebook App
- Copy your app credentials into the `.env` file

For more detailed setup instructions, see [Messenger Platform Quick Start](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/guides/quick-start).
