## How to create a new blog
// TODO

## Your webring
Use Glitch collections to add your friends' blogs to your webring.
<ol>
  <li>Create a Glitch collection</li>
  <li>Add its name to <code>src/_data/siteData.json</code>, in the "collection" field. For example, the 
  collection we're using in this sample is at <a href="https://glitch.com/@notwaldorf/frands">glitch.com/@notwaldorf/frands</a>,
  so we added <code>"collection": "notwaldorf/frands"</code> to the config file.</li>
</ol>
