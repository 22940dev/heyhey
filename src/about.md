Hello! I am a software engineer, though my career started in architecture and urban design technology. The purpose of this site might just be to tinker. Here's my "real" (what is real?) [site](http://jlord.us).

Outside of my day job in computers (hopefully making the web more approachable for all) I enjoy walking, trains, Old English etymology, art from the Dutch Golden age and 90s country music. I contain multitudes!
