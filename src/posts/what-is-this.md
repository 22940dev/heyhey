Great question. [Monica](https://twitter.com/notwaldorf) and I made a [site that uses Glitch collections to make a new-age webring](https://geoglitchies.glitch.me/instructions). It's a static site built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io). You can _remix_ it on [Glitch](https://glitch.com) to create your own site and webring of pals (or whatever).

I've gone and done that myself and now I've got this second site ([first](http://jlord.us)) that I'm gonna tinker with, for fun!
